Classes and objects

-classes are templates for the objects
-objects are the specific instance of that particular class
-each object has a state and that state is defined by its attributes
-the behaviour of each objects are its methods and with them we can manipulate the state of
the object

-each class has attributes (fields as variables) which describe the characteristics of each object - these fields describe the object

-each class has a behaviour which is defined my class methods

Encapsulation
- wrapping the code and data (methods and data) into a single unit called class
- the class is responsible for managing its own fields, data and  variables
- that's why we make them private so nobody can change them, so we can manage them
